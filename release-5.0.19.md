# Release 5.0.19

- **Add/Remove smart fill functionality**: 
  This release introduces the initial implementation of the smart fill functionality, providing users with the ability to automate data entry in certain fields based on detected patterns or previous entries. The smart fill feature enhances productivity by reducing manual data entry, minimizing errors, and speeding up repetitive tasks.

  Key features of the smart fill functionality include:
  
  - **Pattern recognition**: The system now intelligently recognizes patterns in previously entered data, such as asset IDs, part numbers, or location codes, and suggests values that follow the same format. This automation reduces the likelihood of typographical errors and ensures consistency in data input.
  
  - **Toggle option**: Users have the flexibility to enable or disable the smart fill functionality depending on their needs. For certain workflows where automation is beneficial, smart fill can significantly reduce the time required for data entry. Conversely, in situations where manual data entry is preferred, the smart fill feature can be turned off to allow full user control.
  
  - **Application to multiple fields**: The smart fill functionality is applied to several key fields across different Maximo modules, including work orders, assets, inventory, and locations. This ensures that data input for commonly used fields is consistent across the platform.
  
  - **Editable suggestions**: While smart fill suggests values based on patterns, users can easily override these suggestions with custom inputs if needed. This ensures flexibility while still providing the benefits of automation.
  
  - **User-defined patterns**: Administrators can define and customize the smart fill patterns according to organizational needs. This allows the smart fill functionality to be tailored to specific workflows or industry standards, increasing the relevance and accuracy of the automated suggestions.
  
  **Benefits:**
  - **Increased efficiency**: Automating data entry speeds up routine tasks, reducing the need for repetitive typing.
  - **Reduced errors**: By suggesting standardized values, the smart fill functionality helps minimize data entry errors.
  - **Customizable**: Users and administrators can control the scope of smart fill usage, making it adaptable to various workflows.
