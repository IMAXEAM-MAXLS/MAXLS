  This release introduces significant enhancements to the inventory management functionalities within Maximo. These improvements focus on critical inventory operations such as reconciliation, physical counts, and stock adjustments, offering users more control and better performance when managing their inventory data.

  Key improvements include:

  - **Reconciliation enhancements**: 
    - Reconciliation processes in Maximo have been optimized to ensure faster and more accurate reconciliation between physical inventory counts and system records. This helps organizations maintain accurate stock levels and reduces discrepancies between the physical and digital inventory.

The enhancements include the ability to better track stock variances and automatically update system records after a physical count is completed.
    - The improved UI for physical counts makes it easier for warehouse and field staff to enter physical count data, reducing the time spent on inventory checks.

  - **Stock adjustments and transactions**:
    - This release provides new tools for managing stock adjustments. Users can now adjust inventory quantities more precisely, with the system automatically logging all changes and adjustments to ensure transparency in inventory management.
    - Improved handling of inventory transactions, including incoming and outgoing stock movements. This enhancement ensures that transactions such as transfers, issues, and receipts are processed more efficiently, reducing delays in real-time inventory tracking.
  
  - **Integration with other Maximo modules**:
    - Enhancements in this release also improve the integration of inventory transactions with other Maximo modules, such as work orders and asset management. Inventory records are now more tightly linked to maintenance and operational activities, improving overall data accuracy across the system.
